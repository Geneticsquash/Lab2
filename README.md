Today, I worked on getter and setter methods, which at first were confusing, but Iâ€™m getting the hang of it. Also found out about this shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + -" to hide comments in my code, which makes things look less messy. I spent a lot of time trying to understand bigger concepts like Object-Oriented Structure, Generics, Unit Testing, and Version Control. It took a lot of reading, watching videos, and going back over things, but I think it's starting to make sense! 2024-10-10
