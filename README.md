2024-10-10 Today, I learned how to use getter and setter methods,
and discovered the "Ctrl + Alt + -" shortcut to quickly hide comments in code. I also deepened my understanding of key programming concepts like 
Object-Oriented Structure, Generics, Unit Testing, and Version Control by reading, watching tutorials, and exploring online resources.
This combination of hands-on learning and theory is helping me build a solid foundation for my projects.
